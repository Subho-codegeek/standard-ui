# Standard Visual Design System

### How to use Standard Visual Design System - A summary: Pick a layout you need, add components.js to it, then use notification sounds if your project has sound based notification

#### To start, pick one layout among different layouts we have provided in Layouts folder. Every layout is like approved stand-alone HTML visual template on which UI functionality needs to be added. Then add components.js from Standard UI Components folder. This will give access to functional visual elements in your layout template page. Then you can add the rest of functionality

#### We provide four kinds of layouts: A webpage which is box based, a webpage which is tab based, a webpage which has many sections, and a webpage which has sidebars. Depending upon the web project you are doing, pick one of the layouts. Picking the layout is the first task in usage of RanchiMall Standard Visual Design System. You can customize the base layouts with your own colour scheme.
